# Model Performance Improvements

## Issues Identified
The Q&A system was returning incorrect answers with low confidence scores (28-49%) for questions about:
- Total production across years
- Largest crop areas
- Average yields

## Root Causes
1. **Limited Search Results**: Only retrieving top 5 results (too few for complex queries)
2. **High Similarity Threshold**: Requiring 0.1 similarity rejected marginally relevant data
3. **Poor Aggregation**: Basic answer formatting couldn't handle totals, averages, or maximums
4. **No Query Understanding**: System didn't recognize keywords like "total", "largest", "average"

## Improvements Made

### 1. **Increased Search Depth**
- **Changed**: `top_k` from 5 to 10
- **Effect**: Retrieves more relevant chunks from the vector database
- **Files**: `backend/qa_system.py`, `backend/app.py`, `frontend/src/components/Chat.jsx`

### 2. **Lowered Similarity Threshold**  
- **Changed**: Threshold from 0.1 to 0.05
- **Effect**: Accepts marginally relevant results
- **Filtering**: Uses results with similarity > 0.1 for "relevant" answers

### 3. **Enhanced Answer Generation**
Added intelligent query understanding in `_format_crop_answer()`:

#### **Total/Sum Queries**
```python
if 'total' in question_lower or 'sum' in question_lower:
    total_production = sum([d['metadata']['production'] for d in crop_data])
    return f"Total production across {len(crop_data)} records: {total_production:.2f} tons."
```

#### **Largest/Maximum Queries**
```python
if 'largest' in question_lower or 'highest' in question_lower:
    max_result = max(crop_data, key=lambda x: x['metadata'].get('production', 0))
    # Returns the record with highest production
```

#### **Average Queries**
```python
if 'average' in question_lower or 'avg' in question_lower:
    avg_production = np.mean([d['metadata']['production'] for d in crop_data])
    # Returns calculated averages
```

### 4. **Better Default Summaries**
Now shows:
- Number of records found
- States covered
- Crops found
- Calculated averages

## Expected Improvements

### Before:
**Question**: "What was the total production of Rice in Bihar during Kharif season?"

**Answer**: *"Cannot provide total production..."* (28% confidence)

### After:
**Question**: "What was the total production of Rice in Bihar during Kharif season?"

**Answer**: *"Total production across X records: Y tons."* (with proper aggregation)

## How to Apply

### 1. Restart Backend
```bash
cd backend
python app.py
```

### 2. Refresh Frontend
The frontend will auto-reload, or refresh your browser.

### 3. Test Questions
Try asking:
- "What is the total production of rice in Bihar?"
- "Which crop had the largest area in Maharashtra?"
- "What is the average yield of sugarcane in Karnataka?"

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Data Completeness**: These improvements help the model better use available data. If the database doesn't contain:
- Rice data for Bihar
- Maharashtra crop data
- Karnataka sugarcane data

The model still cannot answer those questions accurately.

### To Further Improve:

1. **Verify Data Coverage**: Check if `vector_database.pkl` contains the data you need
2. **Retrain if Needed**: If data is missing, rebuild the vector database with complete datasets
3. **Check Confidence Scores**: Responses with <40% confidence may still be unreliable

## Files Modified

- ✅ `backend/qa_system.py` - Enhanced search and answer generation
- ✅ `backend/app.py` - Increased default top_k
- ✅ `frontend/src/components/Chat.jsx` - Updated to use top_k=10

**Status**: ✅ Ready to test
