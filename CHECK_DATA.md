# Data Quality Check & Solutions

## Problem
Your model can't answer complex statistical questions like:
- "Total production of Rice in Bihar during Kharif season"
- "Which crop had the largest area in Maharashtra"
- "Average yield of Sugarcane in Karnataka"

**Confidence scores are very low (28-49%)** = Database has incomplete or mismatched data.

## Quick Diagnosis

### Option 1: Run the Diagnostic Script

Open terminal in your project folder and run:

```bash
cd backend
python check_database.py
```

This will show you:
- ✅ Total records in database
- ✅ How many Bihar + Rice records exist
- ✅ How many Kharif records exist
- ✅ What states/crops are available
- ✅ If your specific data exists

### Option 2: Manual Check

1. Check your `vector_database.pkl` file size:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ls -lh vector_database.pkl
   # Or on Windows:
   dir vector_database.pkl
   ```

2. If the file is very small (< 1 MB), you likely have incomplete data.

## Solutions Based on Diagnosis

### Solution A: Data Doesn't Exist ❌

**Symptoms:**
- Diagnostic shows 0 Bihar+Rice records
- Few Kharif records
- Limited crop variety

**Fix: Rebuild the database with complete data**

1. **Find your data sources:**
   - Crop production CSV files
   - Soil health CSV files

2. **Ensure data includes:**
   - ✅ Bihar state data
   - ✅ Rice crop data
   - ✅ Multiple years (especially Kharif season)
   - ✅ Multiple states and crops

3. **Retrain the model:**
   You'll need to re-run the data preprocessing and vector database creation.

### Solution B: Data Exists but Search is Failing ❌

**Symptoms:**
- Diagnostic shows Bihar+Rice records exist
- But still getting wrong answers

**Possible Issues:**

#### 1. Metadata Structure Mismatch
The metadata keys don't match what the search expects.

**Check:**
```python
# In your data files, ensure you have:
- 'state' field
- 'crop' field  
- 'season' field
- 'district' field
- 'year' field
```

#### 2. Low TF-IDF Relevance
TF-IDF vectorization might not work well for your data.

**Potential fixes:**
- Increase search depth (already done ✓)
- Check chunk size - smaller chunks = better precision
- Verify text preprocessing is working

### Solution C: Rebuild the Vector Database 🔄

If you need to rebuild the database:

1. **Collect all your source data files:**
   ```
   - crop_production_data.csv
   - soil_health_data.csv
   ```

2. **Check data format:**
   Ensure your CSV has columns like:
   ```
   State, District, Crop, Year, Season, Area, Production, etc.
   ```

3. **Rebuild the vector database:**
   
   You may need to:
   - Find your original data preprocessing script
   - Or create a new one based on your current data structure
   - Run it to generate a new `vector_database.pkl`

## Quick Test: Does Your Current Model Have Any Data?

Try these simple questions:

1. **"What crops are available in Andhra Pradesh?"**
   - If this works = data exists but might be incomplete
   - If this fails = major data issues

2. **"What is the production of wheat in 2010?"**
   - If this works = some data exists
   - If this fails = severe data problems

3. **"List all states in the database"**
   - Check what states are actually available

## Expected vs Actual

### Expected Behavior:
```
Question: "What was the total production of Rice in Bihar during the Kharif season?"

Answer: "Total production across [X] records: [Y] tons."
Confidence: >50%
```

### Current Behavior:
```
Question: "What was the total production of Rice in Bihar during the Kharif season?"

Answer: "I couldn't find any data regarding Rice in Bihar..."
Confidence: 29%
Retrieved: Oilseeds in Uttar Pradesh (completely wrong!)
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Run the diagnostic:
```bash
cd backend
python check_database.py
```

### 2. Check the output for:
- How many total records
- If Bihar + Rice data exists
- What states/crops are available

### 3. Based on results:

**If data exists but limited:**
- The database has incomplete data
- You need to add more datasets
- Contact data provider for complete data

**If data is missing entirely:**
- Your vector database was created with wrong/incomplete data
- You need to rebuild it with correct source files

## Immediate Workaround

While you diagnose the issue, you can:

1. **Lower your expectations** - Ask simpler questions:
   - "What crop data exists for [state]?"
   - "What is the most recent data available?"
   
2. **Use the confidence scores** - Ignore answers with <40% confidence

3. **Check what data exists** - Ask exploratory questions:
   - "What states have data?"
   - "What crops are covered?"

## Long-term Fix

To properly fix this, you need:

1. ✅ **Complete datasets** - All states, all crops, multiple years
2. ✅ **Proper preprocessing** - Correct metadata structure
3. ✅ **Rebuild vector database** - With complete data
4. ✅ **Test before going live** - Verify data coverage
