```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Gemini Package

```bash
cd app/backend
pip install google-generativeai
```

### 2. Configure API Key

The API key is already configured in `app/backend/config.py`:

```python
GEMINI_API_KEY = "AIzaSyC1yEnlXvWwXPapThk76MgN47ZLRwfvMLY"
```

### 3. Start the Enhanced Backend

```bash
cd app/backend
python app.py
```

You should see:
```
Starting Q&A API Server...
Gemini AI integration: Enabled
Server will start on: http://0.0.0.0:5000
```

### 4. Start Frontend

```bash
cd app/frontend
npm run dev
```

## Features

### ‚ú® Enhanced Responses

**Before (Basic):**
> "In Andhra Pradesh, district East Godavari, during 2010 Kharif season, rice was cultivated on 150.50 hectares with a production of 450.25 tons."

**After (Gemini Enhanced):**
> "Based on the data from Andhra Pradesh, specifically East Godavari district, rice production during the 2010 Kharif season was substantial. The crop was cultivated across 150.50 hectares, yielding 450.25 tons. This represents a productive farming season for the region, with approximately 3.0 tons per hectare of yield, which indicates favorable growing conditions."

### üéØ Key Benefits

1. **Natural Language**: Responses feel more human and conversational
2. **Contextual**: Understands the full context of your query
3. **Synthesis**: Intelligently combines multiple data points
4. **Clarity**: Explains complex data in simple terms
5. **Engaging**: More interesting and helpful responses

## API Usage

### With Gemini Enhancement (Default)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "question": "What is rice production in Andhra Pradesh?",
    "use_gemini": true
  }'
```

### Without Gemini (Fallback)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "question": "What is rice production in Andhra Pradesh?",
    "use_gemini": false
  }'
```

## Response Format

```json
{
  "question": "What is rice production in Andhra Pradesh?",
  "answer": "Enhanced answer by Gemini AI...",
  "confidence": 0.45,
  "sources": [...],
  "num_results": 5,
  "ai_enhanced": true
}
```

## Testing the Integration

### Test 1: Natural Question
**Ask:** "Explain rice farming in India"
**Expect:** Comprehensive, natural explanation about rice farming

### Test 2: Specific Data Query
**Ask:** "What is the soil pH in Kerala?"
**Expect:** Specific pH values with context about soil health

### Test 3: Comparative Query
**Ask:** "Compare wheat production in Punjab and Haryana"
**Expect:** Intelligent comparison with insights

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Gemini API Error"
**Solution:** 
- Check internet connection
- Verify API key is correct
- Check API quota limits

### Issue: Fallback to Basic Mode
**Solution:**
- Check if `google-generativeai` is installed
- Verify API key in `config.py`
- Check backend console for errors

### Issue: Slow Responses
**Reason:** Gemini API calls take 1-3 seconds
**Solution:** This is normal for AI-enhanced responses

## Configuration

Edit `app/backend/config.py`:

```python
GEMINI_API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"

# Optional: Add more configuration
GEMINI_MODEL = "gemini-pro"  # Default model
MAX_TOKENS = 1024  # Max response length
TEMPERATURE = 0.7  # Creativity level (0-1)
```

## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** 
- Keep your API key secure
- Don't commit `config.py` to public repositories
- Consider using environment variables in production

## Cost Considerations

Gemini API has a free tier:
- Free tier: 60 requests/minute
- Paid tier: Available for higher usage

Monitor usage at: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey

## Advanced Features

### Custom Prompts

Edit `app/backend/gemini_service.py` to customize how Gemini responds:

```python
# Modify the prompt template
prompt = f"""You are an expert agriculture consultant...

Guidelines:
1. Always cite specific data
2. Use friendly, professional tone
3. Add context and insights
"""
```

### Multi-turn Conversations

The system supports conversation context. For even better results, you can enhance the frontend to track conversation history.
